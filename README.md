# Lumel_Assessment
I would like to mention here that I am unable to solve this assessment to the fullest since I bought a new laptop and unfortunately it did'nt had any softwares intalled in it, it took me around an hour to intall all the necessary softwares, still there were lot of difficulties in running the code. All the tasks I performed were performed in the remainder of the time.

I opted to solve the backend assessment. 

### Database Design:
I created 3 tables named - Order, Product and Customer. As they are necessary for the core calculations of Revenue. I have uploaded a screenshot of the same.
I used Pandas library to segregate the tables from the main csv file using generate_tables.py. I used Mysql for the storinng these tables and using load_csv_mysql.py I created a database and tables. Here again some issies with the setup of mysql, I was unable to import the data to the table.

### Restful Api
I tried using Flask for connecting endpoints but due to some issue with the intallation I was unable to do it.
